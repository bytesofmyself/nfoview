General Information
===================

NFO Viewer is a simple viewer for NFO files, which are "ASCII" art in
the CP437 codepage.  The advantages of using NFO Viewer instead of a
text editor are preset font and encoding settings, automatic window
size and clickable hyperlinks.

NFO Viewer is free software released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), see the file "COPYING" for details.


Dependencies
============

NFO Viewer requires Python [1] 2.4 or greater and PyGTK [2] 2.8 or
greater.  Additionally, a fixed width font with support for CP437
drawing characters is required.  The author recommends Andale Mono
(part of Microsoft's TrueType core fonts [3]).  DejaVu Sans Mono [4]
and Lucida ConsoleP [5] are usable as well.
