Translating NFO Viewer
======================

To avoid doing pointless work, first check the latest list of existing
translations at the head of the master branch

    http://gitorious.org/projects/nfoview/repos/mainline/trees/master/po

To try your translation in the source directory, you can compile it
to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by default)

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/nfoview.mo
    bin/nfoview

When done, send your translation by email to <otsaloma@cc.hut.fi>.
