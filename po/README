Translating NFO Viewer
======================

NFO Viewer translations are available on the Transifex open
translation web service. It is the best place to check the current
status of translations and if you like, you can use the web UI to edit
and submit a translation.

    http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/nfoview/c/master/

In case Transifex is down, you can always check the status of the
translation files in the development repository.

    http://gitorious.org/nfoview/mainline/trees/master/po

Instead of using Transifex, you can also translate NFO Viewer the
traditional way by downloading the source code and editing the
PO-files. To try your translation in the source directory, you can
compile it to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by
default).

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/nfoview.mo
    bin/nfoview

If you don't use Transifex, please send your translation by email to
<otsaloma@cc.hut.fi>.
