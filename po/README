Translating NFO Viewer
======================

To avoid doing pointless work, first check the latest list of existing
translations at the subversion trunk

    http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/nfoview/trunk/po/

To try your translation in the source directory, you can compile it
to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by default)

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/nfoview.mo
    bin/nfoview

When done, send your translation by email to <otsaloma@cc.hut.fi>.
